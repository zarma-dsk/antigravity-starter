## 🎯 KEY VULNERABILITIES DEFENDED

### Synthetic Vulnerabilities (Radware)
- ✅ Semantic over-confidence (clean code that fails on adversarial input)
- ✅ Hallucinated abstractions (non-existent functions)
- ✅ SQL injection via AI-generated builders
- ✅ Ouroboros effect (model poisoning)
- ✅ AI-fingerprinting attacks
- ✅ Slopsquatting (hallucinated packages)

### Code Hallucinations (CodeHalu)
- ✅ Mapping hallucinations (wrong function names)
- ✅ Naming hallucinations (non-existent APIs)
- ✅ Resource hallucinations (missing packages/columns)
- ✅ Logic hallucinations (broken semantics)

### Iterative Degradation (IEEE-ISTAS)
- ✅ Iterations increase vulnerabilities by ~37.6%
- ✅ Feedback loop security degradation
- ✅ Cross-contamination (fixing one bug introduces another)

### Tooling Gaps (ArXiv + Industry)
- ✅ Single-scanner blind spots (miss 30-50% of flaws)
- ✅ Security vs. functionality tradeoff
- ✅ Incomplete secure generation methods

### Ecosystem Risks (All Papers)
- ✅ Model poisoning from bad AI code
- ✅ Supply chain attacks
- ✅ Developer over-confidence bias
