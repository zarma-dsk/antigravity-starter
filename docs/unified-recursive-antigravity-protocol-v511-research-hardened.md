# Unified Recursive Antigravity Protocol

## 🌌 Unified Recursive Antigravity Protocol PROTOCOL 5.1.1
### SYNTHETIC VULNERABILITY HARDENING RELEASE
#### Research-Driven Defense Against All AI-Generated Code Vulnerabilities

---

### 📊 VERSION UPGRADE: 5.0.0 → 5.1.1

#### What Changed?

**5.0.0** = Core architecture + 8-Gate Fortress + Basic AI defense
**5.1.1** = Research-aligned, paper-specific defenses against ALL identified AI code vulnerabilities

#### Research Sources Integrated

This release encodes defenses from:

1. **Radware – Synthetic Vulnerabilities** (2025)[web:485]
   - Hallucinated abstractions & mini-frameworks
   - Semantic over-confidence attacks
   - Ouroboros effect (model poisoning)
   - AI-fingerprinting & supply chain abuse

2. **CSET – Cybersecurity Risks of AI-Generated Code** (2024)[web:471]
   - Over-confidence bias in developers
   - Functionality-first evaluation vs. security-first
   - Human auditor requirement

3. **ArXiv – Comprehensive Study of LLM Secure Code Generation** (2025)[web:475]
   - Single-scanner blind spots (CodeQL alone misses flaws)
   - Security prompts break functionality
   - Multi-tool analysis necessity

4. **IEEE-ISTAS – Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation** (2025)[web:480]
   - Iterations increase vulnerabilities by ~37.6%
   - Feedback loop security degradation
   - Iteration depth constraints needed

5. **CodeHalu – Code Hallucinations in LLMs** (2024)[web:495]
   - Mapping hallucinations (wrong function names)
   - Naming hallucinations (non-existent APIs)
   - Resource hallucinations (missing packages)
   - Logic hallucinations (broken semantics)

6. **ISSTA – LLM Hallucinations in Practical Code Generation** (2025)[web:486]
   - Repo-level hallucinations worse than snippet-level
   - RAG grounding helps but doesn't eliminate risk
   - Boundary-respecting edits critical

7. **CodeSecEval – Secure Code Generation Benchmarks** (2024)[web:483]
   - Residual risk persists even with hardened setups
   - ~7-8% improvement max from secure prompting
   - Assume all AI code remains "suspect"

8. **Industry Reports – Veracode, CSA, GitGuardian** (2024–2025)
   - Slopsquatting (typo attacks) increasing
   - Pattern repetition across AI-generated code
   - npm audit discipline gaps

### 🛡️ UPGRADED 5 SECURITY LOGICS (v5.1.1)

#### Security Logic 1: Hallucination & Grounding Defense (UPDATED)

**5.0.0 version:**
> "Only use established libraries and patterns"

**5.1.1 version (Research-Aligned):**
> "Any new function, class, API, or package appearing first in AI output MUST be grounded in one of: (1) existing repo symbols, (2) official vendor/framework documentation, (3) written design specification with explicit reference. CodeHalu hallucination types (mapping, naming, resource, logic) are treated as high-risk and REQUIRE: test coverage, vendor doc link, and explicit approval."

**How it blocks:**
- ✅ Mapping hallucinations (wrong function names) → caught by IDE/lint
- ✅ Naming hallucinations (non-existent APIs) → caught by TypeScript strict
- ✅ Resource hallucinations (missing packages) → caught by dependency audit
- ✅ Logic hallucinations (broken semantics) → caught by adversarial tests

**Paper sources:** CodeHalu[web:495], ISSTA[web:486]

---

#### Security Logic 2: Adversarial Input & Semantic Robustness (NEW)

**5.1.1 introduction (No prior version):**
> "For every security-critical surface (authentication, authorization, database queries, crypto, user input handling, file I/O, deserialization), AI-touched functions MUST pass adversarial test suites covering: SQL injection patterns, XSS payloads, path traversal attacks, auth bypass attempts, malformed input edge cases, and boundary conditions. Functions passing normal tests but failing adversarial tests are classified as 'semantically over-confident' and REJECTED until redesigned."

**Why this is critical:**
- Radware research shows LLM code is syntactically perfect but fails catastrophically on adversarial input
- Traditional tests don't catch semantic over-confidence
- This explicitly blocks "clean-looking, commented code that's actually vulnerable"

**Test examples:**
```typescript
// ✅ Adversarial test for auth function
describe('adversarial: authentication', () => {
  test('rejects SQL injection in username', async () => {
    const result = await authenticate("' OR '1'='1", "pass")
    expect(result.success).toBe(false) // Must reject, not execute
  })
  
  test('rejects malformed tokens', async () => {
    const result = await authenticate("user", "../../token")
    expect(result.success).toBe(false)
  })
  
  test('rejects boundary inputs', async () => {
    const result = await authenticate("", "")
    expect(result.success).toBe(false)
  })
})
```

---

#### Security Logic 3: Multi-Scanner, Multi-Stage Analysis (UPDATED)

**5.0.0 version:**
> "Run npm audit"

**5.1.1 version (Research-Aligned):**
> "Forbid reliance on a single scanner. At minimum, run: (1) ESLint with security-focused rules, (2) semgrep or CodeQL for code analysis, (3) dynamic/fuzzing tests for high-risk surfaces, (4) npm audit for dependencies. Results from all scanners must be cross-referenced; vulnerability consensus required (not majority vote). Single-scanner green status is NOT sufficient approval."

**Why this is critical:**
- Experimental studies show single tools (like CodeQL alone) miss 30-50% of LLM-introduced flaws
- Different scanners catch different hallucination types
- Multi-stage approach increases detection surface

**Gate 10 Validation expanded:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🛡️ MULTI-SCANNER VALIDATION (5.1.1)"

## Stage 1: Code quality
npm run type-check || exit 1
npm run lint || exit 1

## Stage 2: Dependency security
npm audit --production || exit 1

## Stage 3: Code analysis (static)
npx semgrep --config=p/security-audit src/ || exit 1

## Stage 4: Dynamic tests
npm run test:security || exit 1  # Adversarial tests

## Stage 5: Cross-reference
echo "✅ All 4 stages passed"
echo "✅ Multi-scanner consensus achieved"
```

---

#### Security Logic 4: Controlled Iteration & Scope Constraints (UPDATED)

**5.0.0 version:**
> "Document all changes"

**5.1.1 version (Research-Aligned):**
> "AI-driven 'improve/fix/refactor' loops are capped at 2-3 iterations before mandatory human deep review and fresh threat model. Beyond iteration 3, progress halts and code enters human-only mode. Bulk, repo-wide edits by AI are prohibited; only small, well-scoped diffs (<100 LOC change per commit) are allowed. Each iteration must include fresh threat modeling and security re-assessment, not just functional improvement. Iteration budgets are tracked in commit logs."

**Why this is critical:**
- IEEE-ISTAS research shows iterations INCREASE critical vulnerabilities by ~37.6%
- "Improvements" often introduce new flaws while fixing old ones
- Feedback loop security degradation is documented and measurable

**Iteration tracker:**
```json
{
  "refactor_session": {
    "file": "src/auth/login.ts",
    "iterations": [
      {
        "num": 1,
        "change": "Add password hashing",
        "threat_model": "Brute force, timing attack",
        "tests_passed": true,
        "security_review": "Approved"
      },
      {
        "num": 2,
        "change": "Optimize query",
        "threat_model": "SQL injection (re-check)",
        "tests_passed": true,
        "security_review": "Approved"
      }
    ],
    "max_iterations": 3,
    "status": "Ready for human deep review"
  }
}
```

#### Security Logic 5: Supply Chain & Ecosystem Hardening (UPDATED)

**5.0.0 version:**
> "Validate dependencies before install"

**5.1.1 version (Research-Aligned):**
> "NO package may be installed if: (a) first mentioned in AI output, (b) absent from vetted-dependency list, (c) fails existence check (npm view), (d) fails authenticity check (maintainer identity, repo activity, publish history), (e) fails adoption metrics (<1000 weekly downloads without explicit exception), (f) has known CVEs (npm audit alert), (g) matches typo-squatting patterns (similarity to real packages > 80%). Hallucinated or typo'd packages are explicitly treated as slopsquatting vectors. Each new dependency requires signed-off security decision log entry."

**Why this is critical:**
- Real incidents documented where attackers registered hallucinated package names
- "Fast-async-auth-helper" doesn't exist, but attacker could register it
- Devs following AI suggestions blindly install malware

**Dependency validation checklist:**
```bash
## PRE-INSTALL VALIDATION (5.1.1)

package_name="new-package"

## Check 1: Exists?
npm view $package_name > /dev/null || { echo "❌ Package not found"; exit 1; }

## Check 2: Authenticity
curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/$package_name | jq '.maintainers'
## Verify maintainer has >10 packages, recent activity

## Check 3: Adoption
downloads=$(npm-stats $package_name | weekly_downloads)
[ $downloads -gt 1000 ] || { echo "⚠️ Low adoption"; exit 1; }

## Check 4: Security
npm audit view $package_name

## Check 5: Typo-squatting
npm search $package_name --json | jq '.[] | select(.similarity > 0.8)'
## If similar packages exist, manual verification required

## Check 6: Publish history
npm view $package_name time | head -5  # Recent commits?

echo "✅ APPROVED: Add to vetted-libraries.json"
```

### 🔧 UPGRADED 8-GATE FORTRESS (v5.1.1)

#### Gate 1: INPUT VALIDATION → "Adversarial Validation"

**Enhancement:**
- Test against SQLi, XSS, path traversal, auth bypass payloads
- Use established payload libraries (OWASP, Fuzzing Suite)
- Reject functions that pass normal tests but fail adversarial

**Code gate:**
```typescript
import { validateInput } from './validation'
import { sqlInjectionPayloads, xssPayloads } from './test-fixtures'

// Functional test
test('accepts valid input', () => {
  expect(validateInput('user123')).toEqual({ success: true })
})

// Adversarial test (5.1.1 addition)
test('rejects SQL injection', () => {
  for (const payload of sqlInjectionPayloads) {
    expect(validateInput(payload)).toEqual({ success: false })
  }
})
```

**Paper source:** Radware[web:485]

---

#### Gate 2: AUTHENTICATION (unchanged core)

**5.1.1 addition:**
- Session storage must be validated (not hallucinated)
- Auth function must have explicit grounding in auth library docs

---

#### Gate 3: AUTHORIZATION (unchanged core)

**5.1.1 addition:**
- Permission checks must be non-delegable (not a hallucinated function)
- Cross-verify against role definitions

---

#### Gate 4: RATE LIMITING + ABUSE DETECTION (REINFORCED)

**Enhancement:**
- Detect repeated abnormal patterns (e.g., 100 failed auth attempts)
- Flag semantic over-confidence patterns (legitimate request, wrong response)
- Trace back to AI involvement if pattern matches known LLM boilerplate

**Monitoring rule:**
```typescript
// Detect semantic over-confidence signature
if (isLegitimateLookingRequest(req) && hasWrongSecurityBehavior(response)) {
  log('⚠️ Semantic over-confidence detected')
  triggerSecurityReview()
}
```

**Paper source:** Radware[web:485]

---

#### Gate 5-6: QUERY EXECUTION + HALLUCINATION CHECK

**Enhancement:**
- Forbid raw string interpolation (enforced structurally)
- Detect resource hallucinations (queries for non-existent columns/tables)
- Validate schema match before execution

**Code gate:**
```typescript
// ❌ REJECTED (raw SQL)
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`

// ✅ APPROVED (Prisma, no hallucination possible)
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: parsedId }
})
```

**Paper sources:** Radware[web:485], CodeHalu[web:495]

---

#### Gate 7: OUTPUT SANITIZATION + PROVENANCE TAGGING

**Enhancement:**
- DTO mapping (no leakage)
- Tag all AI-assisted code in commit metadata
- Enable retroactive audit if new vuln patterns discovered

**Example:**
```typescript
// AI-assisted: true (for tracking)
export const sanitizeUserOutput = (user: User): UserDTO => {
  return {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    // ❌ Never leak: password_hash, internal_flags, etc.
  }
}
```

**Commit metadata:**
```
git commit -m "fix: auth refactoring"
git tag -a "ai-assisted:true" -m "This commit involved AI assistance; tagged for re-audit if new patterns emerge"
```

---

#### Gate 8: AUDIT LOGGING + ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION

**Enhancement:**
- Log all changes with AI provenance tags
- Include threat model per change
- Enable tracking for Ouroboros effect prevention

**Log entry (5.1.1):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-16T09:53:00Z",
  "file": "src/auth/login.ts",
  "change_type": "refactoring",
  "ai_assisted": true,
  "ai_tool": "claude",
  "threat_model_checked": ["injection", "auth_bypass"],
  "adversarial_tests_passed": true,
  "multi_scanner_consensus": true,
  "iteration_count": 2,
  "human_approval": "senior-dev-123",
  "notes": "Changed from raw SQL to Prisma, added adversarial tests"
}
```

**Paper sources:** Radware[web:485], ISSTA[web:486]

---

### 🔄 UPDATED 10-STEP METHOD (v5.1.1)

#### Step 3: RESEARCH (REINFORCED)

**5.1.1 additions:**
- Include check for known AI-originated vulnerability patterns from:
  - Radware synthetic vulnerability catalog
  - CodeHalu hallucination types (mapping, naming, resource, logic)
  - Insecure boilerplate patterns documented in recent surveys
  - Iterative degradation patterns from IEEE-ISTAS

**Research checklist:**
```
[ ] Check Radware synthetic vulnerability catalog
[ ] Check CodeHalu hallucination patterns (4 types)
[ ] Check OWASP for security context
[ ] Check framework docs for secure patterns
[ ] Check if similar changes caused issues before
[ ] Document all sources (grounding)
```

**Paper sources:** Radware[web:485], CodeHalu[web:495], Comprehensive Study[web:475]

---

#### Step 6: TEST (ADVERSARIAL + MULTI-STAGE)

**5.1.1 additions:**
- Add "Execution-Based Hallucination Check" inspired by CodeHalu
- Test for mapping hallucinations (wrong function called?)
- Test for resource hallucinations (resource exists?)
- Test for logic hallucinations (semantics correct?)
- Test adversarial payloads on security surfaces

**Enhanced test suite:**
```typescript
describe('CodeHalu detection (Step 6)', () => {
  // Mapping hallucination
  test('uses real functions, not hallucinated ones', () => {
    expect(typeof authenticateUser).toBe('function')
  })
  
  // Resource hallucination
  test('queries real database columns', async () => {
    const schema = await db.getSchema('users')
    expect(schema.columns).toContain('email')
  })
  
  // Logic hallucination
  test('hasCorrectSemantics', async () => {
    const result = await authenticate('user', 'pass')
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('token') // Semantically correct?
  })
  
  // Adversarial robustness
  test('rejects SQLi payload', async () => {
    const result = await authenticate("' OR '1'='1", "pass")
    expect(result.success).toBe(false)
  })
})
```

**Paper sources:** CodeHalu[web:495], Radware[web:485]
