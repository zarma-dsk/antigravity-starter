### Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this protocol and the ecosystem it protects seriously. If you have discovered a vulnerability in the **Unified Recursive Security** or its implementation examples, please report it to us immediately.

**DO NOT** open a public issue on GitHub for security vulnerabilities. Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put the entire community at risk before a patch is available.

#### How to Report

Please report vulnerabilities using one of the following methods:

1.  **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the **Security** tab of this repository. This is the preferred method as it allows for secure collaboration.
2.  **Email**: If private reporting is not available, please contact the core team directly at `security@antigravity.dev`.

#### What to Include

To help us triage and remediate the issue quickly, please include:

-   A description of the vulnerability.
-   Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept code is highly appreciated).
-   The version of the protocol or code where the vulnerability exists.
-   Any relevant logs or output.

#### Our Response

-   We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
-   We will provide regular updates on our progress in verifying and fixing the issue.
-   Once fixed, we will publish a security advisory and credit you for your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

Thank you for helping keep the code-generation ecosystem safe!
